Design Details
Here are the basic design parameters for this exercise:

 - [x] Display the results in a "card" format, where the cards flow from left to right across the width of the screen and then down to the next row creating as many rows as necessary.
 - [x] Each card should display: image, name, artist, set name, and original type. You may also display additional fields.
 - [x] The card's image should be displayed prominently. How and when the other data is displayed is up to you.
 - [x] Use a responsive design. The cards should reflow as-needed based on the size of the browser window. You may limit the maximum display area but may not use a fixed width.
 - [x] As the user scrolls down the page, additional cards should be loaded and appended. (This method of displaying results is often referred to as "infinite scroll.")
 - [x] Include a page header. You may also include additional layout elements at your discretion.
 - [x] Display a loading indicator when communicating with the API.
 - Once your basic design is working, add these additional features (you get to decide all the details):
   - [x] Search (at a minimum, by the card's name)
   - [ ] Sort (card name, set, artist, etc.)

Implementation Requirements
Please be sure to handle the following requirements in your implementation:

 - [x] For this exercise, only display cards that are of type "creature".
 - [x] Initially, display the first 20 results returned by the API.
 - [ ] Use the API to sort the results alphabetically by the card's name.
 - [ ] Retrieve additional pages of results as-needed to fill the window, but do not load more than 50 with each request.
 - [x] Do not preload all results.

Above & Beyond
Is this all too easy, or not sufficient to show off your dev skills? No problem! Complete the requirements and then keep going. Weâ€™d love to see you take this a step further to showcase your creativity and talents. Here are some suggestions, but feel free to come up with some of your own!

 - Filter cards (feel free to exceed the type restriction as long as it defaults to "creature")
 - Display number of cards loaded
 - Group by set (and/or other fields)
 - Show related cards (e.g., cards of the same type, cards in the same set)
 - Add cards to a list or collection (e.g., build a deck)




Things I learned during this project
- Custom hooks
- Unit testing around said hooks
- How to bypass CORS stuff

```
open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir
```

Tricky things

 - For some reason, the MTG API is not honoring either the `contains=imageUrl` or the `multiverseid` query parameters that would allow to filter out duplicates from the API level. I'll need to filter on the component level instead, which isn't ideal.
 - There are simple smoke tests. It turns out that testing isolated components are really straightforward. Intertwined useEffects with an axios call on top of it, not so much.
